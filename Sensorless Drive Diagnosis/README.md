A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Demo


## Features

Abstract:

Features are extracted from motor current. The motor has intact and defective components. This results in 11 different classes with different conditions.Each condition has been measured several times by 12 different operating conditions, this means by different speeds, load moments and load forces. The current signals are measured with a current probe and an oscilloscope on two phases.

The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was used to generate a new database for the generation of features. The first three intrinsic mode functions (IMF) of the two phase currents and their residuals (RES) were used and broken down into sub-sequences. For each of this sub-sequences, the statistical features mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis were calculated.
