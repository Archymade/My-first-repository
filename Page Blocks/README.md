# Project Title

**Page Block Classification**

Binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by re-labeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by Quan Sun.

## Problem Statement

The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page
   layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation
   process. This is an essential step in document analysis
   in order to separate text from graphic areas. Indeed, 
   the five classes are:
   
   - text (1),
   - horizontal line (2),
   - picture (3),
   - vertical line (4) and
   - graphic (5).

   For a detailed presentation of the problem see the sources cited.
